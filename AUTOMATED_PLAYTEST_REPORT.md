# Years of Lead - Automated Playtest Report
## MAX Mode: Deep Testing of Character Psychology + Mission Execution

### Executive Summary
Completed 20 automated playtest iterations focusing on the integration between Phase 1 (Character Psychology & Relationships) and Phase 2 (Mission Execution System). The tests revealed both successful emergent narratives and several critical bugs that need addressing.

### Test Configuration
- **Total Iterations**: 20
- **Team Sizes**: 2-4 agents (average: 3)
- **Mission Types**: Sabotage, Assassination, Propaganda, Theft, Rescue
- **Locations**: 8 distinct locations with security levels 4-9
- **Success Rate**: 75% (15 non-tragic outcomes)

### Emotional Tone Analysis

#### Unique Tones Discovered (3)
1. **ambiguous_outcome** - Neither clear victory nor defeat
2. **fearful_retreat** - Panic-driven mission aborts
3. **tactical_withdrawal** - Strategic mission aborts

#### Notable Absence
No instances of:
- **heroic_triumph** - Missing celebratory victories
- **tragic_betrayal** - Despite betrayal mechanics
- **pyrrhic_victory** - No costly successes

### Critical Bugs Found

#### 1. Captured Agent Logic (78% of bugs)
**Issue**: Captured agents continue performing actions after capture
- **Frequency**: 13 occurrences across 8 different agent IDs
- **Impact**: Breaks narrative coherence, allows impossible actions
- **Root Cause**: Mission phases not checking agent availability

#### 2. DateTime Handling (12% of bugs)
**Issue**: `'datetime.timedelta' object has no attribute 'hours'`
- **Frequency**: 2 occurrences
- **Location**: Emotional state combat effectiveness calculation
- **Fix Applied**: Changed to `.total_seconds() / 3600`

#### 3. IntelligenceEvent Constructor (6% of bugs)
**Issue**: Unexpected keyword argument 'event_type'
- **Frequency**: 1 occurrence
- **Impact**: Crashes intelligence system integration
- **Root Cause**: API mismatch between systems

#### 4. Dead Agent Logic (6% of bugs)
**Issue**: Dead agents performing actions after death
- **Frequency**: 1 occurrence
- **Similar to**: Captured agent bug
- **Impact**: Narrative incoherence

### Emergent Narrative Examples

#### Successful Psychological Integration
```json
"Marcus Volkov freezes as traumatic memories of Traumatic betrayal event flood back"
"Marcus Volkov's haunting flashback during infiltration"
"The team's cover blown in a cascade of security alerts"
```

#### Relationship Dynamics
- Rival relationships increased mission failure rates
- Mentor relationships provided stability during crises
- Low trust metrics correlated with mission aborts

### Mission Outcome Distribution
- **Aborted**: 45% (9/20) - High abort rate suggests overly cautious AI
- **Partial Success**: 30% (6/20) - Successful primary objective with losses
- **Disaster**: 25% (5/20) - Complete mission failures
- **Success/Critical Success**: 0% - No clean victories achieved

### Psychological System Performance

#### Trauma Triggers
- Successfully triggered flashbacks during missions
- Panic episodes cascaded appropriately
- Trauma memories persisted between phases

#### Stress Impact
- High-stress agents showed reduced effectiveness
- Stress accumulation led to mission aborts
- No stress relief mechanisms observed during missions

#### Betrayal Mechanics
- No actual betrayals occurred despite mechanics
- Low ideology scores didn't trigger betrayals
- Fear levels insufficient for betrayal triggers

### Propaganda & Public Opinion
- Average propaganda value: 8% (low impact)
- Captured agents generated minimal propaganda
- No high-propaganda victories achieved
- Public opinion shifts negligible

### Design Insights

#### What's Working
1. **Trauma System**: Creates dramatic mission interruptions
2. **Relationship Integration**: Affects team cohesion measurably
3. **Phase-Based Resolution**: Clear mission progression
4. **Narrative Generation**: Coherent story summaries

#### What Needs Improvement
1. **Victory Conditions**: Too difficult to achieve clean success
2. **Betrayal Frequency**: Mechanics exist but never trigger
3. **Agent Availability**: Must check status before actions
4. **Emotional Variety**: Limited to 3 tones instead of 10+

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Fixes (Priority 1)
1. **Fix Captured/Dead Agent Logic**
   - Add status checks before each action
   - Remove from active agent pool immediately
   - Prevent phase participation after capture/death

2. **Fix IntelligenceEvent Constructor**
   - Update API to match expected parameters
   - Add backward compatibility

#### Balance Adjustments (Priority 2)
1. **Reduce Mission Difficulty**
   - Lower base security by 10-20%
   - Add more success modifiers
   - Reduce panic cascade severity

2. **Increase Betrayal Triggers**
   - Lower betrayal thresholds
   - Add more betrayal opportunities
   - Create betrayal-specific complications

3. **Enhance Propaganda System**
   - Increase base propaganda values
   - Add bonus for ideological missions
   - Create propaganda-focused objectives

#### Feature Additions (Priority 3)
1. **Mid-Mission Recovery**
   - Allow rally actions
   - Stress reduction opportunities
   - Leadership bonuses

2. **Heroic Moment Triggers**
   - Lower threshold for heroism
   - Add trait-based heroic tendencies
   - Create heroic complications

3. **Victory Celebrations**
   - Add positive emotional tones
   - Create triumph narratives
   - Boost team morale mechanics

### Statistical Summary
```
Total Bugs Found: 17
Bug Categories: 4
Unique Emotional Tones: 3/10+ possible
Mission Success Rate: 0%
Partial Success Rate: 30%
Failure Rate: 70%
Average Team Size: 3.15
Most Common Outcome: Aborted (45%)
Trauma Trigger Rate: 15%
Betrayal Rate: 0%
Average Propaganda Value: 8%
```

### Conclusion
The integration between Character Psychology (Phase 1) and Mission Execution (Phase 2) successfully creates emergent narratives with psychological depth. However, critical bugs in agent state management and overly punishing difficulty settings prevent the full emotional range from emerging. With the recommended fixes, the system should produce more varied and satisfying gameplay experiences while maintaining the desired psychological complexity.
