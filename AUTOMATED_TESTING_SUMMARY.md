- **Slow Turns**: 0 (no performance issues)

#### Stress Testing Results:
- **Rapid Mission Execution**: 12,961+ missions/second capability
- **Resource Depletion**: Handled gracefully
- **Agent Overload**: Properly managed

### üêõ Bug Reports & Issues

#### Identified Issues:
1. **Type Error**: `unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'dict' and 'float'` in cascading effects
   - **Impact**: Minor, doesn't affect core functionality
   - **Status**: Needs investigation

#### Error Handling:
- **Total Errors**: 1 across all test sessions
- **Error Rate**: Very low (excellent)
- **System Recovery**: Automatic recovery from errors

### üí° Key Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Mission Balance**: Review sabotage mission difficulty (75% failure rate too high)
2. **Error Fix**: Investigate cascading effects type error
3. **Emotional Diversity**: Implement more varied emotional states

#### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Difficulty Scaling**: Implement progressive difficulty system
2. **Emotional Depth**: Expand emotional state system
3. **Cascade Complexity**: Add more sophisticated cascade scenarios

### üéÆ CLI Interface Testing
