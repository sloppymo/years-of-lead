# Years of Lead - Changelog & Implementation Plan

## Version 1.0.0 - Phase 1 UI/UX Overhaul (2025-06-09)

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **User Location Awareness**: Players always know where they are in the interface

#### 3. Visual Hierarchy Improvements
- **Consistent Section Headers**: All sections use `=` separators for clear boundaries
- **Improved Whitespace**: Better spacing between sections for readability
- **Structured Information Display**: Clear visual separation of different data types

#### 4. User Feedback System
- **Action Confirmations**: Every action provides clear feedback (‚úÖ success, ‚ùå error)
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear messages like "‚úÖ Turn advanced successfully!"
- **Error Prevention**: Comprehensive validation prevents common user mistakes

#### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Input Validation**: Robust error checking for all user inputs
- **Status-Based Restrictions**: Prevents assigning tasks to captured/injured agents
- **Graceful Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with helpful suggestions
- **Default Value Fallbacks**: Automatic fallbacks for invalid inputs

#### 6. Condensed Information Display
- **Agent Overview Table**: One-line summaries with key information at a glance
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status icons (üü¢ active, üî¥ captured, üü° injured)
- **Drill-Down Details**: Option to view detailed agent information on demand
- **Information Density**: More data visible without overwhelming the user

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Code Structure
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns between game logic and UI
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks for user interactions
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation for all user inputs
- **Code Documentation**: Clear docstrings and comments throughout

#### Game Mechanics
