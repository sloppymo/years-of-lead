# Years of Lead - Claude-Friendly Project Summary

## üéØ **Project Overview**
**Years of Lead** is a sophisticated text-based insurgency simulator where players command a resistance movement against an oppressive regime. The game features deep character creation, mission planning, intelligence gathering, and complex narrative consequences.

## üìÅ **Core Architecture** (632 KB - Manageable Size)

### **Main Game Systems** (`src/game/`)

   - 10 background types (Academic, Military, Criminal, etc.)
   - 16 personality traits with mechanical effects
   - Skill system with 8 categories
   - Trauma system with 10 trauma types
   - Realistic funding (multiplied by 100)

2. **Mission Planning** (`mission_planning.py` - 34 KB)
   - 8 mission types (Propaganda, Sabotage, Rescue, etc.)
   - 6 detailed locations with security/support ratings
   - Risk assessment and success probability calculation
   - Resource allocation and time estimation
   - Narrative consequences and action opportunities

3. **Intelligence System** (`intelligence_system.py` - 46 KB)
   - 10 intelligence event types
   - Pattern detection and threat assessment
   - Detailed reports with mechanical effects
   - Action opportunities based on intelligence
   - Database with event tracking

4. **Emotional State** (`emotional_state.py` - 12 KB)
   - 8 emotional dimensions (fear, anger, joy, etc.)
   - Trauma application and decay
   - Emotional stability calculation
   - State transitions and drift

5. **Supporting Systems**
   - **Factions** (`factions.py` - 13 KB): 5 factions with relationship management
   - **Events** (`events.py` - 15 KB): Random event system
   - **Legal System** (`legal_system.py` - 21 KB): Legal consequences
   - **State Management** (`state.py` - 8 KB): Game state persistence

## üß™ **Testing & Quality** (316 KB)
- **20 comprehensive unit tests** (100% pass rate)
- **Robust error handling** throughout all systems
- **Input validation** for all user inputs
- **Detailed logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **Integration tests** for cross-system interactions

## üìä **Key Features**

### **Character System**
```python
# Example character creation
character = creator.create_character(
    name="Agent Smith",
    background_type=BackgroundType.MILITARY,
    primary_trait=PersonalityTrait.LOYAL,
    secondary_trait=PersonalityTrait.CAUTIOUS,
    skill_points=20,
    has_trauma=True
)
```

### **Mission Planning**
```python
# Example mission plan
plan = planner.create_mission_plan(
    mission_type=MissionType.SABOTAGE,
    location_name="industrial_zone",
    participants=[operative1, operative2, operative3]
)
# Results in: Risk assessment, success probability, resource needs
```

### **Intelligence Gathering**
```python
# Example intelligence event
event = generator.generate_event(
    event_type=IntelligenceType.SECURITY_CHANGES,
    location="Government Quarter",
    priority=IntelligencePriority.HIGH,
    source=IntelligenceSource.SURVEILLANCE
)
# Results in: Detailed report, mechanical effects, action opportunities
```

## üéÆ **Game Flow**
1. **Character Creation**: Create operatives with backgrounds, traits, and skills
2. **Mission Planning**: Select mission type, location, and team
3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Collect information about targets and threats
4. **Mission Execution**: (Planned feature) Execute missions with consequences
5. **Consequence Management**: Handle legal, emotional, and faction impacts

## üîß **Technical Highlights**
