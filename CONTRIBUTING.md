```

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/years-of-lead/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
# Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 3. Make Changes
- Follow the coding standards below
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run the test suite
python test_improvements.py

# Run linting
flake8 src/

# Run type checking (if available)
mypy src/
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of changes

- Detailed description of what was added
- Any important notes or considerations
- Related issue: #123"
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length of 88 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Structure
```python
"""
Module docstring explaining the purpose of this module.
"""

import os
import sys
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Constants at the top
MAX_RETRIES = 3
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30

@dataclass
class ExampleClass:
    """Class docstring explaining the purpose of this class."""

    name: str
    value: int

    def example_method(self, param: str) -> bool:
        """
        Method docstring explaining what this method does.

        Args:
            param: Description of the parameter

        Returns:
            Description of the return value

        Raises:
            ValueError: When something goes wrong
        """
        if not param:
            raise ValueError("Parameter cannot be empty")

        return len(param) > 0
```

### Type Hints
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Import types from the `typing` module
- Use `Optional[Type]` for parameters that can be None

### Error Handling
```python
def safe_operation(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[str]:
    """Example of proper error handling."""
    try:
        result = process_data(data)
        return result
    except KeyError as e:
        logger.error(f"Missing key in data: {e}")
        return None
    except ValueError as e:
        logger.error(f"Invalid data format: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return None
```

## üß™ Testing

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new features
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from game.character_creation import CharacterCreator

def test_character_creation_success():
    """Test successful character creation."""
    creator = CharacterCreator()
    character = creator.create_character(
        name="Test Character",
        background_type=BackgroundType.MILITARY,
        primary_trait=PersonalityTrait.LOYAL,
        secondary_trait=PersonalityTrait.PRAGMATIC
    )

    assert character.name == "Test Character"
    assert character.background.type == BackgroundType.MILITARY
    assert character.traits.primary_trait == PersonalityTrait.LOYAL

def test_character_creation_invalid_background():
    """Test character creation with invalid background."""
    creator = CharacterCreator()

    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid background type"):
        creator.create_character(
            name="Test",
            background_type="invalid",
            primary_trait=PersonalityTrait.LOYAL,
            secondary_trait=PersonalityTrait.PRAGMATIC
        )
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python test_improvements.py

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_character_creation.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/
```
