# WILLOW Corpus Numbering Fix Summary

## Date: December 2024

## Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate IDs**: Removed 10 duplicate entries (WILLOW_1184 through WILLOW_1193 appeared twice)
2. **Sequential Numbering**: Renumbered all entries to ensure continuous sequence from WILLOW_1 to WILLOW_1233
3. **Missing IDs**: Eliminated gaps in numbering (previously had 50 missing IDs in the sequence)

## Final Corpus Statistics

- **Total Entries**: 1,233 (down from 1,243 due to duplicate removal)
- **ID Range**: WILLOW_1 to WILLOW_1233 (continuous sequence)
- **Data Integrity**: All entry content preserved exactly as original, only IDs were updated

## Changes Made

1. Kept first occurrence of any duplicate ID
2. Sorted all entries by their original numeric ID
3. Renumbered sequentially starting from WILLOW_1
4. Maintained all other fields (messages, metrics, categories, etc.) unchanged

## Result

The corpus now has clean, sequential numbering with no duplicates or gaps, making it easier to:
- Reference specific entries
- Add new entries with confidence
- Perform data analysis without ID conflicts
- Maintain consistency across the dataset
