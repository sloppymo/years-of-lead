## Additional Metadata
Each entry also includes:

- `tags_version` - Tag schema version (currently 2.0)
- `content_hash` - Unique content identifier

## Usage Examples

### 1. Crisis Routing
```python
if entry["tags"]["urgency_level"] == "immediate":
    route_to_emergency_team()
elif entry["tags"]["legal_risk_level"] == "high":
    route_to_legal_specialist()
```

### 2. Empathy-Based Response
```python
emotion = entry["tags"]["primary_emotion"]
if emotion in ["fear", "sadness"]:
    use_extra_empathy_mode()
elif emotion == "anger":
    use_de_escalation_protocol()
```

### 3. Resource Allocation
```python
if entry["tags"]["complexity_score"] >= 8:
    assign_senior_specialist()
elif entry["tags"]["cultural_sensitivity_needed"]["present"]:
    assign_culturally_trained_agent()
```

### 4. Quality Assurance
```python
if entry["tags"]["response_metrics"]["empathy_indicators"] < 2:
    flag_for_empathy_training()
if not entry["tags"]["response_metrics"]["sets_boundaries"]:
    flag_for_boundary_training()
```
