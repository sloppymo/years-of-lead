- **No specific timeline**: 79 occurrences
  - Some tier 2 responses missing ETAs or time estimates
- **Emergency urgency**: 42 occurrences
  - Some emergency scenarios could emphasize urgency more

### 3. Minor Language Issues
- Minimizing language ("only"): 7 occurrences
- All entries avoided problematic terms (honey, sweetie, etc.)
- No dangerous promises or liability language found

## Strengths

1. **Consistent Two-Tier System**
   - All entries properly implement tier 1 → tier 2 progression
   - Clear separation between containment and action

2. **Legal Safety**
   - No promissory language detected
   - Appropriate use of process language ("I'm dispatching", "working to")

3. **Emergency Response**
   - Most entries include appropriate urgency
   - Clear protocols for 911 activation
   - Building security coordination mentioned

4. **Trauma-Informed Approach**
   - Generally good emotional validation
   - Safety-focused language
   - Empowerment without minimizing

## Recommendations for Phase 2

1. **Standardize Role Names**
   - Use "assistant" for all AI responses (not "staff")
   - Ensure consistent metadata structure

2. **Enhance Emotional Validation**
   - Start more tier 1 responses with validation phrases
   - Examples: "I hear how frightening this is", "I understand you're in pain"

3. **Add Specific Timelines**
   - Include ETAs in tier 2 responses: "Help will arrive in X minutes"
   - Mention response times: "Our team is 5 minutes away"

4. **Increase Urgency Language**
   - For true emergencies, emphasize immediate action
   - Use words like "immediately", "right now", "urgent"

The identified issues are minor and mostly technical (role naming) rather than content quality. The expansion successfully implements:
- ✅ Two-tier response system
- ✅ Trauma-informed communication
- ✅ Legal safety
- ✅ Emergency protocols
- ✅ Realistic scenarios

**Recommendation**: Proceed with integration after fixing the role names in staff entries.
