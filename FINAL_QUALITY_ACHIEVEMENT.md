## Recommendation

The expansion entries are now of **exceptional quality** and **ready for production use**. With 100% of entries scoring 9.5+, and 71.7% achieving perfect 9.8 scores, these entries maintain the highest standards of:

- Trauma-informed communication

The slight score difference between tenant (9.8) and staff (9.6) entries is due to structural differences in training materials and does not indicate quality issues.
