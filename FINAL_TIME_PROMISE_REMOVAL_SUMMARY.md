   - `willow_corpus_complete_final_20250624_000624.jsonl`
   - 45 time promises removed
   - Output: `willow_corpus_complete_final_20250624_000624_no_time_promises_20250624_015146.jsonl`

3. **Previously "Safe" Version**
   - 43 additional time promises found and removed
   - Even the "safe" version had internal service ETAs

### Total Impact
- **212+ total time promises removed**
- **ALL corpus files now free of time commitments**
- **Maximum legal protection achieved**

## What Was Removed

### ❌ ALL Time Promises Including:
- External service ETAs: "Police ETA: 3-5 minutes"
- Internal service ETAs: "Maintenance supervisor en route (ETA 10-15 minutes)"
- Time ranges: "within 24-48 hours", "in 3-5 minutes"
- Specific durations: "30 seconds", "2 minutes", "1 hour"
- Response commitments: "within 24 hours", "in 10 minutes"

### ✅ Replaced With Safe Language:
- "on their way" (instead of specific ETAs)
- "as soon as possible" (instead of time ranges)
- "shortly" / "soon" (instead of specific minutes)
- "immediately" / "right away" (for urgent situations)
- "promptly" (for quick response without commitment)

## Example Changes

**BEFORE**: "Maintenance supervisor en route with master override (ETA 10-15 minutes)"  
**AFTER**: "Maintenance supervisor en route with master override"

**BEFORE**: "We'll respond within 24-48 hours"  
**AFTER**: "We'll respond as soon as possible"

**BEFORE**: "Building security arriving in 30 seconds"  
**AFTER**: "Building security arriving immediately"

## Legal Protection Achieved

1. **ZERO time-based liability** - No promises that could create legal exposure
2. **Consistent communication** - All responses use general timing language
3. **Maintained urgency** - Still conveys priority without specific commitments
4. **Complete coverage** - Applies to ALL services (external AND internal)

## Implementation Guidelines

### NEVER Use:
- ❌ "ETA: X minutes"
- ❌ "arriving in X minutes"
- ❌ "within X hours"
- ❌ "X minute response"
- ❌ Any specific time commitment

### ALWAYS Use:
- ✅ "on their way"
- ✅ "as soon as possible"
- ✅ "shortly"
- ✅ "immediately" (for urgent)
- ✅ "working on this now"

## Final Recommendation

Use the following corpus file for production:
**`willow_corpus_complete_final_20250624_000624_no_time_promises_20250624_015146.jsonl`**

This file contains:
- All 2,375 original entries
- Zero time-based promises
- Maximum legal protection
- Maintained emotional support and urgency

## Verification

To verify no time promises remain:
```bash
grep -E "(ETA|minutes?|hours?|seconds?|arriving in|within \d+)" [corpus_file]
```

The corpus is now fully protected from time-based liability while maintaining its effectiveness in tenant support.
