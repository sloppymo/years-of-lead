# How to Push These Changes to Your Repository

## üö® I Can't Push Directly
I don't have access to your git repositories or GitHub account. You'll need to copy these files to your local repository and push them yourself.

## üìã Quick Steps

### 1. Copy Files from This Workspace
You need to copy these files to your local Years of Lead repository:

**New Files:**
- `automated_playtest.py` (746 lines)
- `AUTOMATED_PLAYTEST_REPORT.md`
- `PLAYTEST_NARRATIVE_HIGHLIGHTS.md`
- `playtest_logs/` (entire directory with 20 JSON files)
- `push_changes.sh` (helper script)

**Modified Files:**
- `src/game/emotional_state.py` (bug fix)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (updated)

### 2. Run the Helper Script
I've created `push_changes.sh` that will do all the git commands for you:

```bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x push_changes.sh

# Run it
./push_changes.sh
```

### 3. Manual Alternative
If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# Stage new files
git add automated_playtest.py AUTOMATED_PLAYTEST_REPORT.md PLAYTEST_NARRATIVE_HIGHLIGHTS.md playtest_logs/

# Stage modified files  
git add src/game/emotional_state.py CHANGELOG.md

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Add automated playtest system and comprehensive testing"

# Push
git push origin main
```

## üéØ What You're Pushing
- **Automated testing framework** that can run 20+ mission iterations
- **Comprehensive bug analysis** with 17 issues identified
- **Narrative highlights** showcasing emergent storytelling
- **Detailed mission logs** in JSON format
- **Critical bug fix** for datetime handling
- **Updated documentation** with test findings

## üîç Files to Download/Copy

If you're working locally, you'll need to download these files from this workspace:

1. Copy the content of each file I've created
2. Paste into new files in your local repository
3. Run the git commands above

## ‚ùì Need Help?
If you're having trouble with any of these steps, let me know and I can:
- Show you the exact content of any file
- Explain any part of the process
- Create different scripts or commands
- Help troubleshoot git issues

The key thing is: **I can create and modify files in this workspace, but you need to copy them to your actual repository and push them yourself.**
