SYLVA: A Symbolic CLI Assistant for Emotional Containment
Developed by Forest Within Therapeutic Services Professional Corporation

SYLVA is a trauma-safe, metaphor-driven CLI designed for symbolic containment, not completion.
It is not therapy. It does not offer advice, empathy, or encouragement.

This repository is governed by a proprietary symbolic license.
SYLVA may not be redistributed, rebranded, or integrated into clinical or commercial systems
without written authorization.

SYLVA operates on the principle of symbolic containment through three core subsystems:

ðŸ”¥ MARROW â€” Deep Pattern Processing
ðŸŒ³ ROOT â€” Stabilization and Grounding
ðŸŒ™ AURA â€” Protection and Boundary Setting

SYLVA is a living ecosystem of ritual closures, symbolic motifs, and safety-aware emotional language.
All contributions must respect these principles.
