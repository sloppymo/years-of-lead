## Example Transformations

### Before:
"Emergency heat repair is coming TODAY at no cost to you"

### After:
"Emergency heat repair, subject to availability, is being prioritized for urgent response at typically no cost to you"

### Before:
"I've scheduled maintenance for tomorrow at 10 AM"

### After:
"I can help coordinate scheduling for maintenance soon, typically within 24-48 hours at 10 AM"

### Before:
"Done! Your lock will be changed within 2 hours"

### After:
"I'll help get that arranged! Your lock should be changed typically within 2-4 hours"

## Impact
These changes ensure Willow:
- Never makes promises it cannot keep
- Maintains supportive tone while being realistic
- Reduces legal liability
- Preserves tenant trust through honest communication
- Focuses on what it CAN do (document, connect, inform, support)

## Verification Needed
While automated fixes have been applied, manual review is recommended for:
1. Context-specific promises that may need additional refinement
2. Ensuring the supportive tone is maintained despite added qualifiers
3. Checking that critical safety situations still convey appropriate urgency
