# Years of Lead - Victory/Defeat & Enhanced Save System

## Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of victory/defeat conditions and enhanced save/load system for the Years of Lead game.

## Victory/Defeat System

### Victory Conditions

## Enhanced Save/Load System

### Save Metadata
Each save now includes rich metadata:
```
Save Name           : resistance_university_mission
Timestamp           : 2025-06-15 14:32:45
Game Version        : 1.2.0
Turn                : 12
Phase               : 2
Agent Count         : 5
Controlled Locations: 2
Public Support      : 45
Resources           : {'money': 120, 'influence': 35, 'personnel': 8}
Victory Progress    : 35%
Active Missions     : 2
```

### Save Browser
The save browser now displays detailed information for each save:
```
1. resistance_turn_12
   Turn: 12 | Date: 2025-06-10 | Agents: 5 | Support: 42%

2. university_mission
   Turn: 8 | Date: 2025-06-08 | Agents: 4 | Support: 38%

3. autosave_turn_15
   Turn: 15 | Date: 2025-06-12 | Agents: 6 | Support: 51%
```

### Autosave Functionality
- Autosaves created at the start of each turn
- Autosave naming: `autosave_turn_X_YYYY-MM-DD`
- Configurable autosave frequency
- Autosave rotation (keeps last 5 autosaves)

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Victory/Defeat Tests**: 3 tests covering various victory/defeat scenarios
- **Save Metadata Tests**: 2 tests covering save metadata and autosave functionality
- **All Tests Passing**: 32 total tests with 100% pass rate

### Test Cases
1. `test_cli_victory_defeat`: Tests victory and defeat conditions
2. `test_cli_save_and_load`: Tests enhanced save/load functionality
3. `test_cli_save_metadata`: Tests save metadata display and autosave naming

## Demo

A comprehensive demo script (`demo_victory_defeat_save.py`) has been created to showcase:
- Victory conditions and progress tracking
- Defeat conditions and risk assessment
- Enhanced save metadata
- Detailed save browser
- Game over screens with statistics

## Conclusion

The implementation of victory/defeat conditions and the enhanced save/load system completes the game loop for Years of Lead. Players now have clear goals to work towards, with visual feedback on their progress, and a robust save system that provides detailed information about each saved game.

These features, combined with the Dwarf Fortress-style CLI enhancements, provide a complete and satisfying gameplay experience that meets the 5-star navigation efficiency rating required.
