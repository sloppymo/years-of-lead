# WILLOW_001-050 Audit Report

## Executive Summary

Audit of entries WILLOW_001-050 reveals **significant quality issues** similar to those found in the synthetic entries (183-203), though less severe. The dataset requires **substantial remediation** before deployment.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Time-Specific Promises** (14 entries affected) 🚨
These create **legal liability** by promising specific outcomes:

- **WILLOW_001**: "emergency repair within 2 hours"
- **WILLOW_002**: "Crew in 1 hour"
- **WILLOW_004**: "emergency team in 2 hours"
- **WILLOW_006**: "plumber today" / "if not fixed by 6pm"
- **WILLOW_009**: "Tech arriving in 1 hour"
- **WILLOW_011**: "Update by 5pm"
- **WILLOW_015**: "Plumber scheduled tomorrow 9am"
- **WILLOW_024**: "Bars installed by 5pm"
- **WILLOW_025**: "Window team arriving in 2 hours"
- **WILLOW_036**: "Tech arriving within 2 hours"

**Risk**: Creates contractual obligations, retraumatization when promises fail

### 2. **Symbol Usage Issues** ⚠️

While not as egregious as the synthetic entries (🧻, 🚷), some symbols lack therapeutic coherence:
- 🐾 (paw prints) - Used in WILLOW_021 for pest issues
- 💸 (money with wings) - WILLOW_035 for financial stress
- 😴 (sleeping face) - WILLOW_034 for insomnia
- 🏥 (hospital) - WILLOW_048 (could trigger medical trauma)

**Good symbols used appropriately**:
- 🌊 (water/flow) - 34 entries
- 💙 (care/support) - 50 entries
- 🌿 (growth/nature) - 14 entries
- 🛡️ (protection) - 5 entries

### 3. **Arousal Management Concerns** ⚠️

Found 2 cases where arousal increased after Willow intervention:
- **WILLOW_002**: 4.2 → 4.5 (after Tier 2 response)
- **WILLOW_011**: 3.0 → 3.3 (after Tier 1.5 response)

While these increases are modest (0.3), they violate the core principle that Willow interventions should stabilize or reduce arousal.

### 4. **Boilerplate Patterns** ⚠️

Many Tier 2 responses follow rigid templates:
```
"Right now:
1. Text [ACTION] for [OUTCOME]
2. [TEMPORARY MEASURE]
3. [DOCUMENTATION]"
```

This lacks the contextual nuance required for trauma-informed care.

## Comparison to Synthetic Entries (183-203)

| Issue Type | WILLOW_001-050 | WILLOW_183-203 |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Time Promises | 28% affected | Unknown (likely higher) |
| Symbol Chaos | Mild (4 questionable) | Severe (🧻, 🚷, 🪲) |
| Arousal Spikes | 4% (2/50) | Multiple 1.0+ spikes |
| Consent Issues | None found | "Minimal" consent at 9.3 arousal |
| Capacity Jumps | None found | Unrealistic 1.9→4.0→5.3 |

## Required Remediation

### 1. **Immediate: Remove All Time Promises**
Replace with process-transparent language:
- ❌ "Tech arriving in 1 hour"
- ✅ "I'm contacting emergency maintenance now"
- ❌ "Fixed by 5pm"
- ✅ "I'll track this throughout the day"

### 2. **Symbol Standardization**
Implement approved symbol set:
```
Medical/Health: ⚕️
Trauma/Safety: 🛡️
Systemic/Advocacy: 🌐
Nature/Grounding: 🌿
Water/Flow: 🌊
Care/Support: 💙
```

### 3. **Arousal Validation Rules**
```python
if tenant_arousal > previous_arousal:
    # Willow MUST acknowledge the increase
    # Cannot proceed to action until stabilized
```

### 4. **Contextual Response Generation**
Replace templates with dynamic responses based on:
- Specific scenario details
- Tenant's emotional state
- Previous interaction history
- Cultural/linguistic needs

## Verdict

**WILLOW_001-050**: Partially deployment-ready after remediation
- Strong therapeutic foundation
- Good consent practices
- Reasonable arousal management (96% effective)

**Key difference from 183-203**: These entries show human-crafted quality with fixable liability issues, while 183-203 appear to be poorly generated synthetic data with fundamental design flaws.

## Recommended Action

1. **Automated fix** for time promises using the liability removal script
2. **Manual review** of symbol usage (quick fix)
3. **Enhance** response variation to reduce templates
4. **Flag** entries 002 and 011 for arousal curve adjustment
5. **Preserve** the strong therapeutic elements while fixing liability issues
