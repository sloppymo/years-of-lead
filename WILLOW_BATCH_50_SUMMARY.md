- Some placeholders (like `{multiple_traumas}`) need manual filling for production use
- All entries pass validation checks for structure and ranges

## Next Steps
1. Review generated responses for placeholder replacement
2. Enhance response specificity where needed
3. Add to main corpus (would bring total to 1,393 entries)
4. Consider generating additional batches for other identified gaps
