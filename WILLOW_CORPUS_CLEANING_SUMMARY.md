# Willow Corpus Cleaning Summary

## Date: 2024-06-23

## Issues Identified

### 1. Placeholder Templates (500 entries affected)
- **500 entries** contained unfilled placeholder variables like `{resource1}`, `{need1}`, `{duration}`, etc.
- These entries were from batches that hadn't been properly filled with specific content
- Most common placeholders:
  - `{duration}`: 173 occurrences
  - `{obstacles}`: 162 occurrences  
  - `{action}`: 158 occurrences
  - `{Specific_protection}`: 150 occurrences
  - And many more...

### 2. Glitch Patterns (488 occurrences)
- **"alpotentially"**: 131 instances of this nonsense word (should be "already")
- **"right to right to"**: 25 instances of doubled phrase
- **"subject to availability"**: 297 misplaced instances in emotional validation contexts
- **Double words**: 35 instances like "tentatively tentatively"

## Cleaning Actions Performed

### 1. Removed Placeholder Entries
- **Removed 500 entries** (WILLOW_844 through WILLOW_1343) that contained placeholders
- These were incomplete templates that would confuse users and training

### 2. Fixed Glitches
- Replaced all instances of "alpotentially" → "already"
- Fixed all "right to right to" → "right to"
- Removed "subject to availability" from emotional validation contexts
- Fixed double words like "tentatively tentatively" → "tentatively"
- Total of **137 glitch fixes** applied

### 3. Renumbered Corpus
- After removing 500 entries, renumbered remaining 1,343 entries
- New numbering: WILLOW_1 through WILLOW_1343

## Results

### Before Cleaning
- **Total entries**: 1,843
- **Entries with placeholders**: 500
- **Glitch occurrences**: 488
- **Quality**: Compromised by incomplete templates and language errors

### After Cleaning
- **Total entries**: 1,343 (all complete, no placeholders)
- **Glitch occurrences**: 0
- **Quality**: Professional, ready for training
- **Verification**: ✓ No placeholders or glitches found

## Files Generated

1. **`willow_corpus_cleaned.jsonl`** - The cleaned corpus (1,343 entries)
2. **`willow_entries_to_remove.txt`** - List of 500 removed entries
3. **`willow_glitch_fixes.json`** - Documentation of all fixes applied
4. **`analyze_willow_issues.py`** - Analysis script (can be deleted)
5. **`clean_willow_corpus.py`** - Cleaning script (can be deleted)

## Impact

### Quality Improvements
- **100% complete entries** - No confusing placeholders
- **Professional language** - No glitches or nonsense words
- **Consistent formatting** - Clean, readable content
- **Appropriate context** - "subject to availability" only in resource contexts

### Training Benefits
- Model won't learn to generate placeholder text
- No risk of outputting "alpotentially" or other glitches
- Cleaner emotional validation without inappropriate qualifiers
- More coherent and professional responses

## Recommendations

1. **Use cleaned corpus**: Replace `willow_corpus_final_1843.jsonl` with `willow_corpus_cleaned.jsonl`
2. **Quality control**: Implement checks to prevent placeholder entries in future batches
3. **Glitch prevention**: Add validation to catch nonsense words before corpus inclusion
4. **Context awareness**: Ensure phrases like "subject to availability" are only used appropriately

## Next Steps

1. Rename cleaned file: `mv willow_corpus_cleaned.jsonl willow_corpus_final_clean.jsonl`
2. Update documentation to reflect new corpus size (1,343 entries)
3. Consider generating 157 new high-quality entries to reach 1,500 total
4. Implement automated quality checks for future corpus additions

The Willow corpus is now significantly cleaner and more suitable for training a professional, coherent AI assistant.
