# Willow Training Corpus Cleanup Summary

## Issue Identified
The corpus had non-sequential numbering with significant gaps:
- WILLOW_001 to WILLOW_080 (80 entries)
- WILLOW_101 to WILLOW_120 (20 entries) 
- WILLOW_200 to WILLOW_202 (3 entries)
- WILLOW_1000 to WILLOW_1099 (100 entries)
Total: 203 valid entries

## Corrupted Data Rejected
User provided entries WILLOW_200-299 that contained nonsensical text like:
- "Their magazine stuff garden he ago"
- "Paper away through environmental store piece base"
- Random word combinations without coherent meaning

These entries were NOT added to the corpus as they:
1. Lacked trauma-informed communication principles
2. Contained no meaningful tenant-landlord dialogue
3. Would have corrupted the training dataset quality

## Action Taken
1. Created renumbering script to fix sequential ordering
2. Renumbered all 203 valid entries sequentially: WILLOW_001 to WILLOW_203
3. Preserved all original high-quality content
4. Backed up original corpus as `willow_training_corpus_200_backup.jsonl`

## Final Corpus Status
- **Total Entries**: 203
- **Numbering**: Sequential from WILLOW_001 to WILLOW_203
- **Quality**: All entries maintain trauma-informed communication standards
- **File**: `willow_training_corpus_200.jsonl`
