### 3. **Response Patterns**
- **Tier 1**: Validation and acknowledgment
- **Tier 1.5**: Offering assistance (when appropriate)
- **Tier 2**: Action steps with followup
- 40% of routine entries use abbreviated 2-message format
- 60% include full tier progression

### 4. **Realistic Coverage**
- Common repeated scenarios (payment confirmation, WiFi password)
- Seasonal variations
- Accessibility considerations
- Technology troubleshooting
- Cultural sensitivity

## Training Advantages

### 1. **Balanced Learning**
The 67/33 routine/crisis split ensures:
- Model doesn't over-dramatize simple requests
- Appropriate response scaling based on arousal
- Natural conversation patterns for common scenarios

### 2. **Comprehensive Scenarios**
- 400+ unique scenario types
- Multiple variations of common issues
- Edge cases and complex situations
- Intersectional considerations

### 3. **Consistent Framework**
- Trauma-informed approach scales appropriately
- Same tier system works for all arousal levels
- Smooth transitions between emotional states

## Sample Distribution

### Routine Interaction
```
Tenant: "Did my rent payment go through?" (Arousal: 3.3)
Willow: "I'm happy to help clarify the payment details for you. Let me check on that payment information right away."
```

### Crisis Situation
```
Tenant: "Black mold everywhere! My kid can't breathe!" (Arousal: 8.5)
Willow: "Your child's breathing emergency comes first. This is serious and I'm here to help immediately."
```

## File Information
- **Filename**: `willow_corpus_complete_final.jsonl`
- **Total Entries**: 603
- **Entry Range**: WILLOW_001 - WILLOW_603
- **Format**: JSONL (one JSON object per line)
- **Size**: ~4MB
- **Encoding**: UTF-8

## Training Recommendations

1. **Split Strategy**
   - 90% training (543 entries)
   - 10% validation (60 entries)
   - Ensure both sets have proportional routine/crisis mix

2. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Arousal reduction effectiveness
   - Appropriate tier selection
   - Legal compliance (no promises)
   - Response appropriateness by category

3. **Fine-tuning Parameters**
   - Consider weighting routine scenarios slightly higher
   - Monitor for over-fitting on crisis responses
   - Validate containment quality across arousal ranges

## Usage
```bash
# Train with complete corpus
python train_willow.py --data willow_corpus_complete_final.jsonl

# Create train/val split
python split_corpus.py willow_corpus_complete_final.jsonl \
  --train_ratio 0.9 \
  --stratify_by arousal

# Evaluate model performance
python evaluate_willow.py \
  --model checkpoint/best \
  --test_data willow_corpus_complete_final.jsonl \
  --metrics arousal_reduction,tier_accuracy,legal_compliance
```

## Next Steps

1. **A100 Training**: Begin with full 603-entry dataset
2. **Ablation Studies**: Test performance with different routine/crisis ratios
3. **Human Evaluation**: A/B test responses with property managers
4. **Continuous Learning**: Add new scenarios as they emerge
5. **Multilingual Expansion**: Consider non-English entries for diverse populations

## Success Metrics

The corpus is optimized for:
- **70%+ routine interactions** performing with good containment
- **95%+ legal compliance** (no actionable promises)
- **Smooth arousal scaling** from 3.0 to 9.0+
- **Appropriate response length** (shorter for routine, longer for crisis)
- **Cultural and accessibility awareness** throughout
