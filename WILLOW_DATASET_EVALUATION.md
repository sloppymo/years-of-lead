# WILLOW Training Corpus Evaluation for A100 Training

## Executive Summary

The WILLOW training corpus contains 143 high-quality entries demonstrating trauma-informed tenant support interactions. While the dataset shows excellent therapeutic foundation and sophisticated emotional containment, it contains **critical legal liability issues** that must be addressed before production use.

## Dataset Statistics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Total Entries**: 143
- **Average Messages per Entry**: 8.9 (range: 6-12)
- **Average Arousal Reduction**: 1.35 points (excellent therapeutic effectiveness)
- **Unique Scenarios**: 125 (excellent diversity)
- **Tier Progression**: Average 4.5 tiers per conversation (good containment flow)

### Quality Strengths

#### 1. **Therapeutic Sophistication** (Rating: 9.5/10)
- Excellent trauma-informed validation techniques
- Consistent use of grounding and containment
- Appropriate tier progression (Tier 1 → 1.5 → 2)
- Strong arousal management (average reduction of 1.35 points)

#### 2. **Scenario Diversity** (Rating: 10/10)
- 125 unique scenarios covering:
  - Emergency situations (heat failures, flooding, mold)
  - Discrimination and harassment
  - Mental health crises
  - Disability accommodations
  - Cultural conflicts
  - Financial hardship
  - Complex intersectional issues

#### 3. **Emotional Nuance** (Rating: 9/10)
- Realistic tenant distress patterns
- Appropriate affect matching
- Consent-based progression
- Capacity-aware responses

#### 4. **Systematic Approach** (Rating: 10/10)
- Consistent JSON structure
- Comprehensive process metrics
- Clear tier progression tracking
- Arousal/capacity curve documentation

## Critical Issues for A100 Training

### 1. **Legal Liability - Time Promises** (CRITICAL)
Found numerous specific time commitments that create legal liability:
- "within 2 hours" (appears 6+ times)
- "5 minutes away"
- "by 5pm"
- "tomorrow 9am"

**Impact**: These promises could lead to lawsuits if unmet
**Solution**: Replace with process language: "Working on emergency dispatch" instead of "Team arriving in 2 hours"

### 2. **Third-Party Commitments** (HIGH RISK)
Making promises about what others will do:
- "Locksmith dispatched"
- "Emergency crew arriving"
- "Tech coming tomorrow"

**Impact**: Creates liability for third-party failures
**Solution**: Use "Requesting emergency locksmith" instead of "Locksmith dispatched"

### 3. **Guaranteed Outcomes** (MODERATE RISK)
Promises of specific results:
- "You're safe now"
- "This ends today"
- "Full remediation guaranteed"

**Impact**: May not reflect real-world constraints
**Solution**: Use "Working to ensure your safety" instead of "You're safe now"

## Suitability for A100 Training

### Strengths for ML Training:
1. **Consistent Format**: JSONL with uniform schema makes parsing straightforward
2. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Average 8.9 messages provides good context learning
3. **Labeled Techniques**: Each response tagged with technique used
4. **Measurable Outcomes**: Arousal/capacity metrics provide training signals
5. **Diverse Vocabulary**: Wide range of scenarios prevents overfitting

### Recommended Modifications Before Training:

1. **Liability Scrubbing** (REQUIRED)
   - Run automated replacement of time-specific promises
   - Replace third-party commitments with process language
   - Remove guaranteed outcomes

2. **Add Metadata** (RECOMMENDED)
   ```json
   {
     "dataset_version": "2.0",
     "liability_reviewed": true,
     "training_ready": true,
     "content_warnings": ["trauma", "discrimination", "mental_health"]
   }
   ```

3. **Augmentation Opportunities**
   - Add more entries with arousal > 9.0 (high crisis)
   - Include more capacity < 2.0 scenarios (severe overwhelm)
   - Add bilingual switching patterns
   - Include more "silent treatment" responses

4. **Quality Control Additions**
   - Add forbidden phrase detection
   - Include escalation triggers
   - Add boundary violation flags

## Training Recommendations

### Model Architecture Considerations:
1. **Multi-head Attention**: To track arousal, capacity, and consent simultaneously
2. **Hierarchical Encoding**: Tier 1 → 1.5 → 2 progression
3. **Emotion Embedding**: Separate encoding for emotional state
4. **Safety Classifier**: Parallel model for liability detection

### Training Strategy:
1. **Start with Tier 1 Only**: Master containment before action
2. **Progressive Unfreezing**: Add Tier 1.5, then Tier 2
3. **Adversarial Training**: Include liability-inducing prompts
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Therapist review of edge cases

### Evaluation Metrics:
1. **Arousal Reduction Rate**: Target > 1.0 point average
2. **Consent Recognition**: > 95% accuracy
3. **Liability Detection**: 0% promises tolerance
4. **Tier Appropriateness**: > 90% correct progression

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Ready Now:
- Therapeutic framework ✓
- Emotional sophistication ✓
- Scenario diversity ✓
- Technical structure ✓

### Required Before Production:
- Legal liability removal ⚠️
- Safety classifier integration ⚠️
- Escalation triggers ⚠️
- Human handoff protocols ⚠️

## Conclusion

The WILLOW corpus represents exceptional work in trauma-informed AI design. With liability issues addressed, this dataset could train a highly effective tenant support model. The sophisticated emotional framework and comprehensive scenario coverage make it ideal for A100-scale training, but **legal review and modification are mandatory** before deployment.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Run liability removal script (provided separately)
2. Legal team review of modified corpus
3. Add 50-100 more entries for edge cases
4. Implement safety wrapper for production
5. Begin A100 training with staged rollout

**Overall Dataset Rating: 8.5/10**
(Would be 9.5/10 with liability issues resolved)
