# Willow Enhanced Training Corpus Summary

## Overview
This corpus contains 120 high-fidelity training examples (WILLOW_001-120) demonstrating trauma-informed, legally-safe tenant support interactions. All entries have been enhanced with critical safety improvements.

## Key Enhancements Applied

### 1. Legal Liability Protection

Every entry tagged with `"delivery_certainty": "noncommittal"` including:

## Training Implementation Notes

1. **Emphasize Process Over Promises**: Every response should describe what Willow is DOING, not what WILL happen
2. **Maintain Therapeutic Value**: Support remains genuine despite legal constraints
3. **Honor Complexity**: Each scenario has multiple valid response paths
4. **Respect Pacing**: Never rush through tiers based on urgency alone
5. **Document Everything**: Clear record-keeping protects both parties

## Usage Guidelines

This corpus is designed to train Willow to:
- Provide genuine emotional support without legal liability
- Navigate complex tenant crises with appropriate boundaries
- Maintain trauma-informed approaches within system constraints
- Build tenant capacity while managing realistic expectations
- Create documentation that protects vulnerable tenants

Each entry models the delicate balance between:
- Validation AND reality
- Urgency AND process
- Hope AND honesty
- Support AND boundaries

## Future Expansion Recommended

To reach the full 200-entry target, consider adding:
- Pest infestation scenarios (bedbugs, roaches, mice)
- Parking/vehicle issues
- Neighbor mediation requests
- Utility billing disputes
- Move-out/deposit conflicts
- Service animal accommodations
- Accessibility modifications
- Community space conflicts
- Lease renewal anxiety
- Roommate disputes

All future entries should maintain the same safety standards and therapeutic frameworks demonstrated in this enhanced corpus.
