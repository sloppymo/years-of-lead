# WILLOW AI Training Dataset Expansion Summary

## Overview
Successfully expanded the WILLOW AI training dataset following the comprehensive expansion roadmap. The corpus now contains **843 unique entries** demonstrating trauma-informed, promise-free communication across diverse scenarios.

## New Additions

### 1. Boundary-Centered Crises (50 entries: WILLOW_1301-1350)
- **Focus**: Safety threats, de-escalation, dignity preservation
- **Scenarios**: Threats to staff, eviction resistance, hoarding, weapons, property damage, self-harm, animal hoarding, domestic violence, substance use, and more
- **Key Features**:
  - Clear safety protocols without antagonism
  - High-trust redirection techniques
  - "You're not in trouble—this is about everyone's safety" framework
  - Tier 1 containment even in escalated emergencies

### 2. Intersectional Vulnerabilities (50 entries: WILLOW_1351-1400)
- **Focus**: Multiple overlapping barriers and systemic failures
- **Scenarios**: Undocumented + disability, trans elders, Indigenous family separation, refugee trauma, sex worker parents, chronic illness + poverty, and more
- **Key Features**:
  - Layered awareness of identity-related stress
  - Alternative pathways when traditional systems fail
  - "Your situation is valid even when systems don't make room for it" approach
  - Cultural and linguistic competence

## Quality Improvements

### Enhanced Process Metrics
All new entries include:
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for tracking
- `resolution_status`: Current state of the issue
- `escalation_path`: Next steps if needed
- `tier_escalated`: Boolean for crisis overrides
- `skip_tier_2`: Reason when bypassing normal progression

### Consistent Patterns
- **Tier Progression**: All entries start with Tier 1 (containment) before any action
- **Arousal Reduction**: Realistic curves showing gradual de-escalation
- **Capacity Building**: Shows how co-regulation increases tenant capacity
- **Promise-Free Language**: No fixed timelines or personal guarantees

### Symbolic Language Variety
Balanced across entries:
- `none`: Direct, clinical approach
- `minimal`: Light metaphors for connection
- `traditional`: Cultural or generational references
- `nature`: Environmental metaphors for grounding

### Categories Covered
- `boundary_crisis`: Safety threats requiring immediate intervention
- `intersectional_vulnerability`: Multiple overlapping systemic barriers
- Plus existing categories from original corpus

## Key Phrases and Techniques

### Universal Safety Frame
- "You're not in trouble—this is about everyone's safety"
- "Your [emotion/need] is valid"
- "Let's [collaborative action]"

### Trauma-Informed Responses
- Validation before action
- Choice and control emphasis
- Strength-based language
- Non-judgmental approach

### Promise-Free Patterns
- "Working toward" instead of "will"
- "Options include" instead of "I'll make sure"
- Process transparency without guarantees
- Contingency acknowledgment

## Deployment Readiness

The expanded corpus is ready for:
1. **ML Training**: Consistent format for model ingestion
2. **Quality Assurance**: Clear metrics for evaluation
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Tagged for easy filtering and analysis
4. **Real-World Application**: Covers diverse, complex scenarios

## Files Created
- `willow_expansion_boundary_crises.jsonl`: 50 boundary crisis scenarios
- `willow_expansion_intersectional.jsonl`: 50 intersectional vulnerability scenarios
- `willow_corpus_complete_final.jsonl`: Complete corpus with 843 entries

## Next Steps
Consider expanding:
- Legal documentation scenarios
- Emergency response coordination
- Community building initiatives
- Preventive maintenance communication
- Long-term relationship building
