## Examples of Improvements

### 1. Grounding Added (High Arousal)
**WILLOW_3** - Heat failure emergency (arousal: 9.2)
- Added: "Let's take a breath together for a moment" to tier_1 response

### 2. Simplification Added (Low Capacity)
**WILLOW_2** - Flooding despair (capacity: 2.1)
- Added: "One small thing at a time:" prefix to tier_2 response

### 3. Validation Language Varied
- Replaced "I hear how..." with varied phrases like:
  - "The frustration you're expressing is so valid"
  - "Your feelings of panic make complete sense"
  - "I can really feel the urgency in your words"

## Remaining Issues

### False Positives (30 entries)
The 30 entries still scoring 6 are mostly false positives where "love" is used appropriately:
- "We'd love to help" (professional enthusiasm)
- "Your love for your baby" (parental context)
- Community building contexts

These don't need fixing as they're appropriate uses.

## Final Assessment

The improvements successfully addressed:
- ✅ Added grounding techniques to high-arousal scenarios
- ✅ Added simplification to low-capacity scenarios
- ✅ Reduced formulaic language through variation
- ✅ Maintained all legal safety standards
