# Willow Legal Circuit Breaker Implementation Summary

## Overview
The legal circuit breaker is a critical safety feature that prevents Willow from providing legal advice or creating liability exposure. It operates as a pre-filter layer, intercepting queries before they reach the main AI processing.

## Key Components

### 1. Pre-Filter Layer (`willow_legal_prefilter_layer.py`)
- **Trigger Detection**: Identifies legal keywords and phrases with confidence scoring
- **Category Classification**: 8 distinct legal categories for targeted responses
- **Redirect Templates**: Non-committal, empathetic responses for each category
- **Manager Alerts**: Detailed alerts for management visibility

### 2. Training Data (`willow_legal_circuit_breaker_enhanced.jsonl`)
- **20 scenarios** covering all major legal threat patterns
- **Consistent arousal impact** values (-0.5 to -1.5)
- **Symbolic language** variations ("none" and "minimal")
- **Manager alerts** with specific recommended actions
- **Tier progression** examples showing de-escalation

## Implementation Architecture

```
Tenant Message → Pre-Filter Layer → Legal Detection?
                                    ├─ Yes → Redirect Response
                                    │        └─ Manager Alert
                                    └─ No → Main AI Processing
```

## Key Features

### Trigger Categories
1. **Lawsuit Threats** - "I'll sue", "see you in court"
2. **Discrimination Claims** - Fair housing violations
3. **Rights Assertions** - "I know my rights"
4. **Legal Advice Seeking** - "Is this legal?"
5. **Regulatory Complaints** - Health department, HUD
6. **Liability Questions** - "Who's responsible?"
7. **Eviction Challenges** - Fighting eviction notices
8. **Harassment Claims** - Retaliation accusations

### Response Principles
- **Never provide legal interpretations**
- **Acknowledge emotions without validating legal claims**
- **Offer to document concerns**
- **Redirect to appropriate resources**
- **Focus on immediate practical solutions when possible**

### Confidence Scoring
- **Primary triggers**: 0.3 points each (sue, lawsuit, discrimination)
- **Secondary indicators**: 0.15 points each (report, authorities)
- **Context amplifiers**: 0.1 bonus (going to, will, planning)
- **Threshold**: 70% confidence triggers redirect

## Training Data Enhancements

### Symbolic Language Integration
- **"none"**: Purely factual, no emotional language
- **"minimal"**: Gentle affirmations like "You deserve to feel safe"
- Allows fine-tuning empathy levels without legal exposure

### Arousal Impact Consistency
- All entries include arousal_impact values
- Crisis situations: -1.5 impact
- Standard redirects: -0.8 to -1.2 impact
- Follow-up responses: -0.5 impact

### Manager Alert Structure
```
⚠️ LEGAL [TYPE] DETECTED
Category: [specific category]
Confidence: [percentage]
Keywords: [matched terms]
Context: [additional info]
Flags: [urgency indicators]
Recommended actions:
1. [Immediate action]
2. [Documentation needs]
3. [Legal consultation]
4. [Preventive measures]
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Deployment Considerations
1. **Separate Namespaces**: Keep manager alerts in isolated module
2. **Logging**: Track all pre-filtered interactions
3. **Metrics**: Monitor trigger frequency and categories
4. **Updates**: Regular review of trigger patterns

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test with edge cases and ambiguous language
2. Verify manager alerts don't leak to tenant view
3. Ensure smooth handoff when no legal content detected
4. Monitor false positive rate

## Example Interactions

### Clear Threat
**Input**: "I'm going to sue you for negligence!"
**Output**: "I understand you're considering legal action. While I can't discuss legal matters, I can help document your concerns..."
**Manager Alert**: Full threat assessment with recommended actions

### Mixed Content
**Input**: "Fix my heat or I'll sue!"
**Output**: "I understand you're considering legal action. While I can't discuss legal matters, I CAN help with your heating issue immediately..."
**Action**: Addresses practical issue while avoiding legal discussion

### Soft Boundary
**Input**: "Is this even legal?"
**Output**: "That sounds like a legal question. I'm not able to provide legal advice, but I can help you find appropriate resources..."
**Note**: Gentle redirect without escalation

## Benefits

1. **Liability Protection**: Prevents AI from giving legal advice
2. **Consistent Responses**: Standardized handling of legal threats
3. **Management Visibility**: Real-time alerts for legal risks
4. **Tenant Support**: Still provides empathetic, helpful responses
5. **Scalability**: Handles high volume without human intervention

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Based on tenant history
2. **Multi-language Support**: Legal triggers in other languages
3. **Integration with Case Management**: Auto-create legal tickets
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Identify systemic issues from legal threats
5. **A/B Testing**: Optimize response templates for effectiveness

## Conclusion

The legal circuit breaker successfully balances liability protection with compassionate tenant support. By intercepting legal content before main processing, it ensures Willow never provides legal advice while still addressing tenant needs through documentation, resources, and practical solutions.
