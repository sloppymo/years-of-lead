## Executive Summary
Successfully addressed critical overpromising and liability issues across the Willow AI training corpus, reducing high-risk entries from 34.2% to 0.4%.

## Analysis Results

### Original Corpus (843 entries)
- **High Risk (Score 1-3)**: 288 entries (34.2%)
- **Moderate Risk (Score 4-6)**: 283 entries (33.6%)
- **Safe (Score 7-10)**: 272 entries (32.3%)

- **Moderate Risk (Score 4-6)**: 405 entries (48.0%)
- **Safe (Score 7-10)**: 435 entries (51.6%)

### New Batch (500 entries)
- **Entries Modified**: 431 (86.2%)
- **Entries Already Safe**: 69 (13.8%)

## Key Patterns Fixed

### 1. Immediate Action Promises
**Before**: "I'll fix this immediately" / "right now" / "ASAP"  
**After**: "as soon as possible" / "we'll work to address this"

### 2. Legal Judgments
**Before**: "This is illegal" / "violates the law"  
**After**: "may not comply with regulations" / "potential issue"

### 3. Timeline Commitments
**Before**: "within 24 hours" / "by tomorrow"  
**After**: "as soon as possible" / "soon"

### 4. Financial Guarantees
**Before**: "we'll cover the cost" / "full refund"  
**After**: "we can explore coverage options" / "potential reimbursement"

### 5. Safety Assurances
**Before**: "you're safe now" / "never happen again"  
**After**: "we're working on your safety" / "we'll work to prevent this"

## Implementation Details

### High-Risk Replacements Applied
- Removed all absolute promises and guarantees
- Eliminated specific timeline commitments
- Replaced legal conclusions with tentative language
- Modified financial commitments to exploratory language
- Softened safety assurances to effort-based statements

### Moderate-Risk Adjustments
- Changed "I can/we can" to "I can help explore"
- Modified "available/ready" to "potentially available"
- Adjusted "scheduled/confirmed" to "tentatively scheduled"
- Replaced "approved/authorized" with "under review"

### Safety Additions
- Added "subject to availability" where appropriate
- Included "pending review" for uncertain outcomes
- Used "typically" to indicate common but not guaranteed patterns
- Incorporated "we'll do our best" for effort-based commitments

## Remaining Considerations

### Three High-Risk Entries
The three remaining high-risk entries (WILLOW_37, WILLOW_93, WILLOW_562) contain references to reimbursement that may be contextually appropriate but should be manually reviewed.

### Moderate-Risk Patterns
48% of entries remain at moderate risk, primarily due to:
- "I can/we can" phrases (346 occurrences)
- "available/ready" language (125 occurrences)
- "scheduled/confirmed" terms (22 occurrences)

These are acceptable with proper context but should be monitored.

## Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. Response Templates
Use pre-approved language patterns:
- "I'll help explore options for..."
- "We can work together to address..."
- "Let me check what's typically available..."
- "Subject to availability and review..."

### 2. Avoid These Patterns
- Never promise specific outcomes
- Don't guarantee timelines
- Avoid legal conclusions
- Don't commit to financial obligations
- Never assure absolute safety

### 3. Emphasize Process Over Outcome
- "I'll help you file a request..."
- "We can start the review process..."
- "Let's document this issue..."
- "I'll coordinate with the team..."

## Files Generated
1. `willow_corpus_liability_fixed.jsonl` - Fixed original corpus
2. `willow_batch_500_fixed.jsonl` - Fixed new batch
3. `fix_willow_overpromising.py` - Reusable fixing tool

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Replace current training data with liability-fixed versions
2. Implement pre-deployment screening using the risk scorer
3. Create response guidelines based on safe patterns

### Long-term Improvements
1. Develop automated testing for overpromising language
2. Create a style guide for trauma-informed yet legally safe responses
3. Implement regular audits of generated responses
4. Train content creators on liability-aware writing

## Conclusion
The liability fixes successfully transform Willow from a high-risk system to a legally safer one while maintaining empathetic, trauma-informed communication. The 99% reduction in high-risk content significantly reduces potential legal exposure while preserving the supportive nature of the responses.
