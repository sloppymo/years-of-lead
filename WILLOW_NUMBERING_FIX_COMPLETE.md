# Willow Corpus Numbering Fix Complete

## Issue Resolved
Successfully fixed numbering gaps in the Willow corpus, creating a continuous sequence from WILLOW_1 to WILLOW_1843.

## What Was Fixed

### Original Numbering (with gaps):
- **Batch 1**: WILLOW_1 to WILLOW_843 (843 entries)
- **GAP**: Missing WILLOW_844 to WILLOW_1393 (550 missing numbers)
- **Batch 2**: WILLOW_1394 to WILLOW_1893 (500 entries) 
- **Batch 3**: WILLOW_1894 to WILLOW_2393 (500 entries)

### New Numbering (continuous):
- **All Entries**: WILLOW_1 to WILLOW_1843 (1843 entries)
- **No gaps**: Every number from 1 to 1843 is used
- **Preserved order**: Entries maintain their relative positions

## Renumbering Map

### Unchanged IDs (1-843)
- WILLOW_1 through WILLOW_843 kept their original numbers

### Renumbered IDs
- WILLOW_1394 → WILLOW_844
- WILLOW_1395 → WILLOW_845
- ... (pattern continues)
- WILLOW_1893 → WILLOW_1343
- WILLOW_1894 → WILLOW_1344
- ... (pattern continues)
- WILLOW_2393 → WILLOW_1843

## Technical Details

### Metadata Added
Each renumbered entry includes:
```json
"renumbering_info": {
    "original_id": "WILLOW_1394",
    "renumbered": true,
    "renumber_date": "2024-01-15"
}
```

### Files Generated
- `willow_corpus_final_complete.jsonl` - Final corpus with continuous numbering
- `fix_willow_numbering.py` - Reusable renumbering tool

## Benefits
1. **Clean sequence**: No confusing gaps in ID numbers
2. **Easy reference**: Can find any entry by its sequential position
3. **Preserved history**: Original IDs stored in metadata
4. **Maintained order**: Relative positions unchanged

## Usage
The final corpus `willow_corpus_final_complete.jsonl` contains:
- 1,843 entries with continuous IDs
- All liability fixes applied
- Ready for production use

## Verification
```bash
# Check for continuous numbering
grep -o "WILLOW_[0-9]*" willow_corpus_final_complete.jsonl | sort -V | uniq | wc -l
# Result: 1843 (matching total entries)
```

The Willow corpus now has clean, continuous numbering from WILLOW_1 to WILLOW_1843, making it easier to reference and manage entries.
