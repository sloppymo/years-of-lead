# Willow Corpus Numbering Fix Summary

## Date: 2024-06-23

## Issue Identified
The `willow_corpus_final_1843.jsonl` file had a numbering gap:
- Entries WILLOW_1 through WILLOW_843 (843 entries)
- Then jumped to WILLOW_1394 through WILLOW_2393 (1000 entries)
- Total: 1843 entries with non-sequential numbering

## Fix Applied
1. Created a script to analyze the numbering patterns
2. Identified the gap between WILLOW_843 and WILLOW_1394
3. Renumbered all entries sequentially from WILLOW_1 to WILLOW_1843
4. Preserved the original order of entries

## Results
- **Before**: IDs ranged from 1 to 2393 with a gap
- **After**: IDs are now sequential from 1 to 1843
- **No duplicates**: Verified no duplicate IDs exist
- **No gaps**: Continuous numbering throughout
- **Correct order**: Entries remain in their original sequence

## Files
- **Original**: Backed up as `willow_corpus_final_1843_original.jsonl`
- **Fixed**: Now saved as `willow_corpus_final_1843.jsonl`
- **Total entries**: 1843 (unchanged)

## Verification
The fix was verified by:
1. Checking first entries: WILLOW_1, WILLOW_2, WILLOW_3
2. Checking last entries: WILLOW_1841, WILLOW_1842, WILLOW_1843
3. Confirming no duplicates, gaps, or out-of-order entries

The corpus is now properly numbered for training and reference purposes.
