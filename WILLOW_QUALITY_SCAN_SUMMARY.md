# WILLOW Corpus Quality Scan Summary

## Overall Quality Assessment

### Statistics
- **Total entries scanned**: 1,558
- **Entries scoring 9 or 10**: 1,243 (79.8%)
- **Entries scoring less than 9**: 315 (20.2%)
- **Lowest score**: 6 (no entries scored below 6)

### Quality Distribution
```
Score 10:  522 entries (33.5%) ████████████████████
Score  9:  721 entries (46.3%) ███████████████████████
Score  8:  170 entries (10.9%) █████
Score  7:  112 entries (7.2%)  ███
Score  6:   33 entries (2.1%)  █
Score 5-1:   0 entries (0%)    
```

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. False Positives for "Love" (33 entries)
Many entries were flagged for using "love" but in appropriate contexts:
- "Your age doesn't determine your **love** for your baby" (parental love)
- "We'd **love** to help with that" (professional enthusiasm)
- Community building contexts where "love" refers to caring for community

**Recommendation**: Refine the scanner to distinguish between inappropriate endearments and appropriate uses of "love"

### 2. Missing Validation in High-Stress Scenarios (100+ entries)
Entries with high arousal (>8.0) sometimes lack explicit grounding techniques like:
- Breathing exercises
- Safety affirmations
- Moment-to-moment awareness

### 3. Low Capacity Without Simplification (80+ entries)
When capacity is below 3.0, some responses don't include:
- Breaking down into simple steps
- One-thing-at-a-time approach
- Clear, simple language

### 4. Formulaic Language (50+ entries)
Some entries use standard trauma-informed phrases repeatedly:
- "I hear how..."
- "That sounds really..."
- "It makes sense that..."

## Quality Strengths

### High-Quality Features Present
1. **No actual inappropriate endearments** (honey, sweetie, darling)
2. **No dangerous overpromising** in the scanned entries
3. **Strong tier progression** in most entries
4. **Consistent trauma-informed approach**
5. **Legal safety maintained** throughout

### Best Practices Observed
- Clear consent signals before moving to action
- Emotional validation present in 80%+ of entries
- Arousal/capacity tracking consistent
- Non-committal language for deliverables

## Recommendations

### Immediate Improvements Needed
1. **Add grounding techniques** to all high-arousal (>8.0) scenarios
2. **Simplify language** for all low-capacity (<3.0) scenarios
3. **Vary validation phrases** to reduce formulaic feel
4. **Review context** for flagged words like "love" before marking as issues

### Scanner Improvements
1. Distinguish between contextual uses of words
2. Add positive quality indicators, not just negative
3. Consider scenario complexity when scoring
4. Weight issues based on actual harm potential

## Conclusion

The corpus demonstrates **strong overall quality** with 79.8% of entries scoring 9 or above. The issues identified are primarily:
- Technical/scanner limitations (false positives)
- Opportunities for enhancement rather than critical flaws
- Consistency improvements rather than safety concerns

The corpus is production-ready with minor refinements recommended for the 20% scoring below 9.
