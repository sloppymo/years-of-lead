## Key Themes Addressed

### Intersectional Vulnerabilities
- Climate displacement + cultural erasure
- Disability + undocumented status
- Trans identity + rural isolation
- Indigenous identity + state violence
- Cognitive disability + grief/loss
- Age + LGBTQ+ identity + conservative regions

### Systemic Violence Patterns
- Bureaucratic abandonment
- Institutional control disguised as care
- Economic coercion through housing
- Cultural genocide through placement
- Medical borders and healthcare denial
- Surveillance as "support"

### Response Techniques

#### Tier 1 Validation Techniques
- Climate abandonment witness
- Borderland isolation witness
- Carceral care paradox
- Rightlessness witness
- Systemic trap witness
- Religious violence witness

#### Tier 1 Deeper Naming Techniques
- Structural violence naming
- Intergenerational trauma recognition
- Institutional violence naming
- Exploitation system naming
- Perpetual punishment naming
- Belonging exile paradox

#### Tier 2 Resource Techniques
- Community resource mapping
- Indigenous housing sovereignty
- Psychiatric liberation resources
- Sanctuary resource mapping
- Family preservation resources
- Rural queer resistance

## Cultural Sensitivity
- 13 scenarios marked culturally sensitive (52%)
- Appropriate handling of:
  - Indigenous sovereignty and ceremony
  - Religious persecution contexts
  - Language and immigration issues
  - Climate refugee experiences
  - Cultural displacement grief

## Symbolic Language Usage
- **None**: 24 scenarios (96%)
- **Minimal**: 0 scenarios
- **Traditional**: 0 scenarios
- **Nature**: 0 scenarios

This reflects the prompt's guidance for minimal symbolic language unless culturally appropriate.

## Arousal Impact Patterns
- Initial validation: -0.8 to -1.0 (high impact)
- Deeper validation: -0.6 to -0.7 (moderate impact)
- Resource provision: -0.6 to -0.8 (stabilizing impact)

## Resolution Status Types
- Community organizing/building
- Identity affirming
- Autonomy restoration
- Underground support
- Reunification supporting
- Resistance building
- Education preserving
- Dignity seeking
- Emergency connecting
- Cultural reconnection

## Escalation Paths
Each scenario includes specific escalation paths relevant to the population:
- Climate justice collective
- Indigenous housing network
- Psychiatric survivor network
- Sanctuary network
- Family reentry advocacy
- Rural LGBTQ+ legal support
- Foster alumni network
- Elder LGBTQ+ advocacy
- Cognitive disability advocacy
- Autistic housing network

## Notable Edge Cases

### Most Critical Scenarios
1. **Trans youth rural homelessness** - Family rejection + geographic isolation
2. **Pacific Islander climate displacement** - Cultural death in concrete housing
3. **Indigenous youth state custody** - Cultural genocide through child welfare
4. **Undocumented domestic worker** - Modern slavery with passport theft
5. **Elderly reentry** - 40 years incarceration, world transformed

### Unique Intersections
1. **Disabled + Undocumented** - Wheelchair user crawling in basement
2. **Trans + Elder + Care facility** - Identity erasure in vulnerability
3. **Cognitive disability + Grief** - Exploitation after mother's death
4. **Climate refugee + Racism** - "You're from Africa, used to heat"
5. **Foster youth + Disability** - Nursing home suggested for 18-year-old
