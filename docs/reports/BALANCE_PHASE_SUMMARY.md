## 🧠 Core Focus This Cycle
Brief description of the focus area.
Example: "Resolve agent state errors (dead/captured), enable basic success outcomes, diversify emotional tone in mission narratives."

---

## ✅ Key Improvements Implemented

1. **Agent State Validation Fix**
   - Captured and dead agents now removed from valid_action_pool.
   - Patch: `agent_state_manager.py` line 74

2. **Mission Difficulty Rebalance**
   - Reduced security alert ramp rate by 15%.
   - Increased stealth modifier from relationships (+5%).

3. **New Emotional Tone Added**
   - `heroic_success`: triggers if all agents survive + ≥80% objective value.
   - New outcome text variants added to `narrative_results.py`.

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Mission Success Rate | 0.0% | 21.3% | 🔼
| Agent Panic Frequency | 34.0% | 27.1% | 🔽
| Betrayal Incidence | 0.0% | 4.2% | 🔼

## 📖 Highlighted Narratives

- “Alexei defied orders to rescue a wounded comrade, saving both.”
- “Against all odds, the team escaped undetected through service tunnels.”
- “A last-second EMP shut down surveillance — the operation was a ghost.”

---

## 🛠️ Next Phase Recommendations

- Tune betrayal weight thresholds further (currently slightly too low).
- Enable relationship-based mission synergy bonuses.
- Monitor for new failure modes introduced by stealth rebalancing.
