EMERGENT ITERATION LOOP - Years of Lead
==========================================
Start Time: 2025-06-10T12:00:00
Target: 20+ iterations, 3+ new emotional tones, 2+ new features

ITERATION 001 - 2025-06-10T12:00:00
------------------------------------
**Priority**: Bug Fix - Captured Agent Logic
**Issue**: Captured agents continue performing actions in subsequent mission phases
**Solution**: Added captured/casualty check in execution phase before agent actions
**File**: src/game/mission_execution.py
**Lines Changed**: 3 (added lines 629-631)
**Diff**:
```
+ # Skip if already incapacitated or captured  
+ if agent.id in report.casualties or agent.id in report.captured_agents:
+     continue
```
**Expected Impact**: 
- Improves narrative coherence score (from 0.7 → 0.8+)
- Fixes logical inconsistency bug reported in automated playtest logs
- Reduces "captured agents acting" incidents by 100%

**Test Status**: Ready for validation
**Health Impact**: Should improve overall health from 0.625 → 0.65+

ITERATION 002 - 2025-06-10T12:15:00
------------------------------------
**Priority**: Feature Addition - Emotional Tone System
**Issue**: Limited narrative tone diversity (only 3 emotional tones found in playtests)
**Solution**: Added comprehensive EmotionalTone enum with 10 distinct tones and determination logic
**File**: src/game/mission_execution.py
**Lines Changed**: 47 (added enum + method + integration)
**New Tones Added**:
- TRIUMPHANT_VICTORY, HEROIC_SACRIFICE, TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL
- DESPERATE_STRUGGLE, BITTERSWEET_SUCCESS, PYRRHIC_VICTORY  
- FEARFUL_RETREAT, BETRAYAL_TRAGEDY, REDEMPTIVE_MOMENT, AMBIGUOUS_OUTCOME
**Expected Impact**:
- Increases narrative variety from 3 → 10 potential emotional tones
- Improves narrative coherence score (0.7 → 0.8+)
- Enables richer storytelling and emotional engagement
- Meets requirement for "3+ new emotional tones"

**Test Status**: Ready for validation  
**Health Impact**: Should improve overall health from 0.65 → 0.7+

ITERATION 003 - 2025-06-10T12:30:00
------------------------------------
**Priority**: Game Balance - Mission Difficulty Adjustment  
**Issue**: 0% clean success rate in automated playtests, missions too difficult
**Solution**: Reduced extraction difficulty and improved skill check success rates
**File**: src/game/mission_execution.py
**Lines Changed**: 4 (2 extraction difficulty, 1 skill check, 1 comment)
**Balance Changes**:
- Base extraction difficulty: 0.3 → 0.2 (10% easier escape)
- Failed mission extraction penalty: 0.2 → 0.15 (5% easier)  
- Skill check base bonus: +0.1 (10% better performance)
**Expected Impact**:
- Increases mission survival rate from 0% → 15-25%
- Reduces mission difficulty from "extreme" → "hard"
- Should enable some successful missions for better narrative variety
- Improves player experience without making game trivial

**Test Status**: Ready for validation
**Health Impact**: Should improve overall health from 0.7 → 0.75+

ITERATION 004 - 2025-06-10T12:45:00
------------------------------------
**Priority**: Bug Fix - Emotional Consistency System
**Issue**: EmotionalState.get_combat_effectiveness() references undefined self.stress attribute
**Solution**: Replace self.stress with proper stress level calculation using existing emotions
**File**: src/game/emotional_state.py
**Lines Changed**: 3 (replaced 1 line + added 2 comment/calculation lines)
**Bug Fix**:
- Removed: `if self.stress > 0.8:`
- Added: `stress_level = max(self.fear, self.sadness, self.anger, self.trauma_level)`
- Fixed logic to use actual emotional state values
**Expected Impact**:
- Eliminates AttributeError crashes in combat effectiveness calculations
- Improves emotional consistency score (0.8 → 0.9+)
- Ensures proper psychological stability checks work correctly
- Better combat effectiveness calculations based on actual emotional state

**Test Status**: Ready for validation
**Health Impact**: Should improve overall health from 0.75 → 0.8+

ITERATION 005 - 2025-06-10T13:00:00
------------------------------------
**Priority**: Feature Addition - Dynamic Betrayal Threshold System
**Issue**: Static betrayal chances don't reflect mission context and narrative tension
**Solution**: Added contextual modifiers that make betrayal probability dynamic based on mission state
**File**: src/game/mission_execution.py
**Lines Changed**: 18 (added contextual mission modifiers and trait considerations)
**New Feature**:
- Mission context modifiers: casualties (+5% each), failing objectives (+8%), high heat (+6%)
- Personal performance impact: failed actions (+4%), panic episodes (+3% each)
- Additional trait modifiers: CAUTIOUS (+20%), RECKLESS (-20%)
- Creates realistic escalation where desperate situations breed betrayal
**Expected Impact**:
- More narrative-appropriate betrayals (happens when missions go badly)
- Reduces random betrayals during successful missions
- Creates emergent storytelling where stress and failure create dramatic tension
- Meets requirement for "new feature" addition
- Improves emotional authenticity and player agency understanding

**Test Status**: Ready for validation
**Health Impact**: Should improve overall health from 0.8 → 0.82+
