# Complete Time Promise Removal Report

## Summary

Removed ALL time promises from WILLOW corpus for maximum legal protection.

**Date**: 2025-06-24 01:51:46

## Changes Made

### Removed ALL Time Promises Including:
- ❌ External service ETAs (police, fire, medical)
- ❌ Internal service times (building security, maintenance)
- ❌ All specific minute/hour promises
- ❌ Time ranges (e.g., "10-15 minutes")
- ❌ "Within X minutes" statements

### Replaced With Safe Language:
- ✅ "on their way"
- ✅ "as soon as possible"
- ✅ "shortly"
- ✅ "promptly"
- ✅ "immediately" (for very urgent)
- ✅ "right away" (for urgent)

## Legal Protection Achieved

1. **ZERO time-based liability** - no promises we might not keep
2. **Consistent expectations** - all responses use general timing
3. **Maintained urgency** - still conveys priority without specifics
4. **Complete protection** - applies to ALL services, internal and external

## Implementation Principle

**NEVER promise specific times for ANYTHING:**
- No ETAs
- No "X minutes" promises
- No time ranges
- Use general urgency terms only
