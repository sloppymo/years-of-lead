## Changes Made

### Removed
- ❌ "Police ETA: 3-5 minutes"
- ❌ "Paramedics arriving in 6 minutes"
- ❌ "Fire department ETA: 4 minutes"
- ❌ "Emergency services arriving in 5 minutes"
- ❌ "Ambulance ETA: 8 minutes"
- ❌ "Gas company ETA: 7 minutes"

### Replaced With
- ✅ "Police have been notified"
- ✅ "Emergency medical services have been called"
- ✅ "Fire department has been notified"
- ✅ "Emergency services have been contacted"
- ✅ "on their way" / "as quickly as possible"

## Acceptable Promises Retained

Only kept time promises for services we control:
- ✅ "Building security arriving in 30 seconds"
- ✅ "Our emergency team will be there in 2 minutes"
- ✅ "Building staff arriving in 90 seconds"

## Legal Safety

This update ensures:
1. No liability for external service response times
2. No false expectations about arrival times we can't control
3. Focus on what we ARE doing (notifying, dispatching, coordinating)
4. Only promise times for our own staff/services
