## Changes Made

### Removed
- ❌ "Police ETA: 3-5 minutes"
- ❌ "Paramedics arriving in 6 minutes"
- ❌ "Fire department ETA: 4 minutes"
- ❌ "Emergency services arriving in 5 minutes"
- ❌ "Ambulance ETA: 8 minutes"
- ❌ "Gas company ETA: 7 minutes"
- ❌ All specific time promises for external services

### Replaced With
- ✅ "Police have been notified"
- ✅ "Emergency medical services have been called"
- ✅ "Fire department has been notified"
- ✅ "Emergency services have been contacted"
- ✅ "on their way" / "as quickly as possible"
- ✅ Focus on actions taken, not arrival times

## Acceptable Promises Retained

Only kept time promises for services we control:
- ✅ "Building security arriving in 30 seconds"
- ✅ "Our emergency team will be there in 2 minutes"
- ✅ "Building staff arriving in 90 seconds"
- ✅ "Our maintenance team arriving shortly"

## Legal Safety Achieved

This comprehensive update ensures:
1. **No liability** for external service response times
2. **No false expectations** about arrival times we can't control
3. **Focus on actions** we ARE taking (notifying, dispatching, coordinating)
4. **Only promise times** for our own staff/services
5. **Legal protection** from claims about delayed external services
6. **Maintained empathy** while being legally responsible

## Implementation Notes

- All assistant responses now avoid specific ETAs for:
  - Police, Fire, Paramedics, Ambulance
  - Utility companies (gas, electric, water)
  - Any third-party emergency services
- Retained specific times only for building-controlled services
- Preserved emotional support and validation
- Maintained urgency without creating liability
