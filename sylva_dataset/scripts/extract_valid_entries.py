The discomfort you feel is the growing edge of self-discovery. Consider keeping a private journal where you can explore these different facets without judgment. Notice which interactions leave you feeling most aligned with your inner experience. The fact that you're questioning authenticity suggests you have a deeper sense of self that's seeking expression.

What you're describing is compassion fatigue, a occupational hazard for those who give of themselves professionally. The guilt you feel actually indicates that your caring nature is still intact, just temporarily overwhelmed. Consider implementing the 'airplane oxygen mask' principle - you cannot care for others sustainably without first attending to your own needs. This might mean setting firmer boundaries, taking actual lunch breaks, or seeking supervision to process difficult cases. Professional self-care isn't selfish; it's essential for ethical practice. Your awareness of this shift is the first step toward reclaiming your professional vitality. Let it be named and left."
