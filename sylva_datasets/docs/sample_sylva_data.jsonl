I'm searching for purpose but can't find it anywhere.", "assistant_response": "The path reveals itself one step at a time. What feels lost is often in the process of being found.

It feels like I'm standing between who I was and who I might become.", "assistant_response": "Thresholds are spaces of becoming. The edge holds both what was and what is emerging.

I've changed so much that I can't go back to who I used to be.", "assistant_response": "Return is not about going backward but integrating what has been transformed. The container holds what needs holding."}
