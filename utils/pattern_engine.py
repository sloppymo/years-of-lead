Pattern Engine for SYLVA - Phase 2 Enhanced
Analyzes emotional patterns in user interactions using keyword-to-emotion mapping.

Provides symbolic analysis of emotional frequencies for trauma-safe reflection
without clinical interpretation or advice-giving.

Phase 2 Features:
- Emotion frequency tracking (7/30/90 day summaries)
- Subsystem tension mapping (ðŸ”¥/ðŸŒ³/ðŸŒ™ balance analysis)
- Ritual closure intensity scaling (light/medium/heavy endings)
- Drift-aware pattern summaries ("You have left the mountain path...")
