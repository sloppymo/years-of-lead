# Willow Simple Maintenance Scenarios Dataset Summary

## Overview
This dataset contains 100 simple maintenance scenarios (WILLOW_901-1000) where tenants encounter common issues that have easy, DIY solutions. These scenarios demonstrate Willow's ability to guide tenants through simple troubleshooting steps, empowering them to solve problems independently while building their confidence.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. **Problem Types Covered**
- **Water/Plumbing**: Shut-off valves, aerators, toilet mechanisms, slow drains
- **Electrical**: Circuit breakers, outlet issues, light fixtures, dimmer switches  
- **HVAC**: Thermostat settings, filter changes, vent adjustments
- **Appliances**: Dishwashers, washing machines, dryers, refrigerators
- **General Maintenance**: Door adjustments, window mechanisms, locks, squeaks

### 2. **Common Patterns**
- Issues often caused by user error or lack of knowledge
- Simple adjustments or cleaning resolve most problems
- Basic household items used for fixes (vinegar, baking soda, WD-40)
- Emphasis on preventive maintenance education

### 3. **Response Structure**
- **Tier 1**: Clear diagnostic guidance with specific steps
- **Tier 2**: Positive reinforcement and preventive tips
- Arousal consistently decreases as tenants gain control
- Capacity increases through empowerment and learning

### 4. **Educational Elements**
- Teaching tenants to identify switch-controlled outlets
- Explaining normal vs. concerning symptoms (dimmer warmth vs. hot switches)
- Providing maintenance schedules (filter changes, drain cleaning)
- Sharing "tricks of the trade" (ice cubes for carpet dents, shaving cream for mirrors)

### 5. **Safety Considerations**
- Clear differentiation between DIY-safe and professional-required issues
- Immediate safety guidance for potential hazards (CO detector beeps)
- Encouraging tenants to report persistent issues
- Acknowledging when professional help is needed

## Arousal/Capacity Patterns
- **Initial Arousal**: Typically 3.5-5.5 (moderate concern/frustration)
- **Post-Tier 1**: Drops by 1.5-2.0 points after solution identified
- **Final Arousal**: Usually 2.0-3.0 (relief and satisfaction)
- **Capacity Growth**: Increases by 1.0-1.5 points through empowerment

## Training Value
This dataset teaches Willow to:
1. Quickly identify simple vs. complex issues
2. Provide clear, actionable troubleshooting steps
3. Build tenant confidence through successful problem-solving
4. Educate on preventive maintenance
5. Recognize when professional help is needed
6. Maintain appropriate boundaries (temporary fixes vs. permanent solutions)

## Integration Notes
- Complements emergency response scenarios by handling non-urgent issues
- Reduces maintenance request volume through tenant empowerment
- Builds positive tenant-management relationships
- Creates opportunities for community knowledge sharing
- Supports sustainability through proper appliance maintenance
